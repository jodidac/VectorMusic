# Vector Music
## A Mathematical Framework for Musical Generation

Vector Music is a sophisticated mathematical framework that reimagines musical composition through the lens of differential geometry, tensor fields, and multi-agent systems. By treating musical elements as geometric objects within a carefully constructed manifold, it provides a unified approach to algorithmic composition that naturally encompasses both traditional musical concepts and emerging computational methods.

## Core Concepts

- **Geometric Naturality**: Musical relationships and transformations emerge naturally from the geometry of the space
- **Physical Intuition**: Musical dynamics mirror physical systems, leveraging our understanding of physical laws
- **Emergent Complexity**: Sophisticated musical structures emerge from the interaction of simple, well-defined components
