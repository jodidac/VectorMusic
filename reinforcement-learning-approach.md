# Reinforcement Learning in Musical Space
## A Physics-Inspired Approach to Melodic Generation

### 1. Core Concept
The system approaches melodic generation as a physical learning problem, where an agent learns to navigate a musical space through reinforcement learning, similar to how virtual robots learn to walk through physics simulation.

### 2. Musical Physics Engine

#### 2.1 Physical Space Properties
- **Dimensions**
  - Primary: Pitch (vertical) Ã— Time (horizontal)
  - Secondary: Velocity, Energy, Tension
- **Field Forces**
  - Harmonic gravity wells around chord tones
  - Melodic inertia affecting directional movement
  - Stepwise motion friction
  - Tension-resolution potential fields

#### 2.2 Conservation Laws
- **Energy Conservation**
  - Kinetic energy in melodic movement
  - Potential energy in harmonic tension
  - Energy expenditure in large intervals
  - Recovery through resolution points

#### 2.3 Movement Dynamics
- **Basic Forces**
  - Local attraction to chord tones
  - Directional inertia in melodic lines
  - Resistance to large interval jumps
  - Resolution tendencies in voice leading

### 4. Learning Framework

#### 4.1 Reward Structure
- **Immediate Rewards**
  ```
  R_immediate = w1 * resolution_value +
                w2 * movement_efficiency +
                w3 * harmonic_alignment -
                w4 * energy_cost
  ```

- **Delayed Rewards**
  ```
  R_delayed = w5 * phrase_completion +
              w6 * motif_development +
              w7 * form_coherence +
              w8 * energy_management
  ```

#### 4.2 Training Phases

1. **Motor Learning**
   - Environment: Empty musical space
   - Goal: Basic movement control
   - Rewards: Movement efficiency
   ```python
   def motor_reward(state, action):
       return efficiency_score - energy_cost
   ```

2. **Harmonic Navigation**
   - Environment: Static harmonic fields
   - Goal: Harmonic awareness
   - Rewards: Resolution success
   ```python
   def harmonic_reward(state, action):
       return resolution_value + field_alignment
   ```

3. **Pattern Development**
   - Environment: Dynamic harmonic context
   - Goal: Motif creation and development
   - Rewards: Pattern coherence
   ```python
   def pattern_reward(state, action):
       return motif_contribution + development_score
   ```

        self.physics_engine = PhysicsEngine()
        
    def step(self, action):
        # Apply physical laws
        new_state = self.physics_engine.apply(action)
        # Calculate rewards
        reward = self.calculate_reward(new_state)
        # Update environment
        self.update_fields()
        return new_state, reward

        harmonic_force = self.calculate_harmonic_force()
        inertial_force = self.calculate_inertial_force()
        friction_force = self.calculate_friction()
        
        # Compute resultant movement
        resultant = self.combine_forces([
            harmonic_force,
            inertial_force,
            friction_force
        ])
        
        return self.update_state(resultant)
```

#### 5.2 Agent Implementation
```python
class MelodicAgent:
    def __init__(self):
        self.state = AgentState()
        self.policy_network = PolicyNetwork()
        self.value_network = ValueNetwork()
        
    def select_action(self, observation):
        # Process environmental observation
        state_encoding = self.encode_state(observation)
        # Get action distribution
        action_dist = self.policy_network(state_encoding)
        # Sample action
        action = self.sample_action(action_dist)
        return action
        
    def update(self, experience):
        # Update policy and value networks
        policy_loss = self.calculate_policy_loss(experience)
        value_loss = self.calculate_value_loss(experience)
        self.optimize_networks(policy_loss, value_loss)
